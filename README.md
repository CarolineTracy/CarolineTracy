**About Me**

My name is Caroline Tracy. I'm a rising junior at Wesleyan University majoring in Computer Science. I have a deep passion for problem-solving, and I love using my skills to tackle real-world issues. I have a strong mathematical background and love to take math classes (despite not majoring in it). Outside of school and work you can find me listening to music and doing logic puzzles (Sudoku is my favorite).
