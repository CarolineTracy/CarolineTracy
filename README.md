**About Me**

Hi! My name is Caroline Tracy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✰ &nbsp;I'm an incoming Software Engineering Intern at Oracle.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✰ &nbsp;I'm a junior at Wesleyan University majoring in Computer Science.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✰ &nbsp;I have a deep passion for problem-solving, and I love using my skills to tackle real-world issues.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✰ &nbsp;Outside of school and work you can find me listening to music and doing logic puzzles (especially Sudoku).  

**Currently Working On...**

**Projects in my GitHub**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⭑ &nbsp;**Implementing a Functional Language**: Implementing OCaml- (a subset of OCaml) and writing an interpreter for it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⭑ &nbsp;**Cell Tracking**: A software that processes cell movement videos and produces a variety of quantitative outputs for use by Wesleyan University's Mitchel Lab, a biology research laboratory. The lab uses these outputs to map the rules governing the movements of cell groups and to support cancer research.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⭑ &nbsp;**TicTacToe AI**: An AI I created that you can play TicTacToe against. Created using Standard ML.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⭑ &nbsp;**Naïve Bayes Classifier**: A naïve Bayes classifer I created, which is a simple machine-learning algorithm. Created using Standard ML.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⭑ &nbsp;**Dictionary Hash Table**: An implementation of a dictionary using a hash table. Created using C.
