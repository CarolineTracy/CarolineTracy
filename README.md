**Projects in my GitHub**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ú∞ &nbsp;**Cell Tracking**: A software that processes cell movement videos and produces a variety of quantitative outputs for use by Wesleyan University's Mitchel Lab, a biology research laboratory. The lab uses these outputs to map the rules governing the movements of cell groups and to support cancer research.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ú∞ &nbsp;**TicTacToe AI**: An AI I created that you can play TicTacToe against. Created using Standard ML.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ú∞ &nbsp;**Na√Øve Bayes Classifier**: A na√Øve Bayes classifer I created, which is a simple machine-learning algorithm. Created using Standard ML.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ú∞ &nbsp;**Dictionary Hash Table**: An implementation of a dictionary using a hash table. Created using C.
